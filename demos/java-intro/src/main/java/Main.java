        Data types in Java
        byte - 8 bits, use for anything that needs to be 8 bits. Usually small numbers or characters.
        char - single character. representation based on encoding. In Java this is UTF-8 by default.
        short - integer type, but smaller than an int (fewer bits, thus can hold fewer possible values)
        int - 32-bit signed integer. Can hold negative and positive whole numbers. -2147483648 to 2147483647
        long - 64-bit signed integer. Can hold enormous negative and positive values. -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 - 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
        float - floating point type, holds fractional (decimal) values.
            Floats use a different form of math to preform arithmetic operations. See more info on floats below.
        double - a bigger (more precise) floating point type.

        Notes on Floats: Floats use a totally different type of arithmetic called floating point operations, or FLOPS.
        Floats store numeric values in three parts: Base, Precision, and an exponent. It's similar to scientific notation.
        Floats and doubles, because of the way they work, have a property called precision. This basically means that
        floats and doubles can store many many more representations than you might expect, but some of these get less
        precise when the decimal values get very very tiny. This can result in things like 0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3 being false,
        due to precision the result of the addition might end up 0.299999999999999999999999991 or something.
